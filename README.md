JACoDoma stands for Just Another COding DOjo MAnager

In August 2015 some developers at eGym decided to start a coding dojo in the company and the first programming language we used was Go. As nobody there had reasonable knowledge on this language, it's not hard to imagine the quality of the code they've written.

But as a lot of nice ideas came out from this (and the next ones, I hope), I decided to put them in practise writing a Coding Dojo application to assist our meeting and simultaneasly gain some Go skills.

One will eventually notice this software is too complex to its purpose.. 
That's intentional, as its original author wants to put some dumb ideas in practise just for fun and for learning. 
Just that.

Contributions are more than welcome :-)
